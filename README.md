# SwiftI2C

This component provides Swift bindings for I2C communication on ESP32 devices within the ESP-IDF framework.

It offers high-level Swift APIs for I2C master operations, simplifying the integration of I2C devices in Swift-based ESP-IDF projects.

## Status

This is an initial implementation of SwiftI2C. It provides basic functionality for the I2C master and will be extended with additional features in future updates.

## How to use it

To use SwiftI2C in your ESP-IDF project, include it as a component and import the necessary modules in your Swift source files. Refer to the component's source code for detailed API documentation and examples.

## Requirements

- ESP-IDF framework
- Swift toolchain compatible with ESP32
- I2C hardware support on the target ESP32 device
